# File Hiding and Unhiding System

This is a Maven-based Java project that provides a **file hiding and unhiding** system, implemented with **Java** and **MySQL**. Unlike traditional encryption and decryption, this system focuses on obfuscating file data to prevent unauthorized access while enabling retrieval in its original form.

## Features

- **Hide Files:** Securely hide file data using a custom obfuscation technique.
- **Unhide Files:** Retrieve the original file data from its hidden state.
- **Database Integration:** File metadata is stored and managed using a **MySQL** database.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on any platform supporting Java.
